# Spark
This is based on my code for the course PLP of CentraleSup√©lec

# Task
Create a Spark Streaming app that reads Velib data from velib.behmo.com (port 9999)
Every 5s: print the empty Velib stations
Every 5s: print the Velib stations that have become empty
Every 1 min: print the stations that were most active during the last 5 min (activity = number of bikes borrowed and returned)
